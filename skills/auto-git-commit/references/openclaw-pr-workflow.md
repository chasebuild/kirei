# OpenClaw PR Workflow (Excerpt)

This reference summarizes the OpenClaw PR workflow guidance used as a baseline.

## Commit Workflow Highlights

- Prefer repo-specific commit tooling when available (OpenClaw uses a `scripts/committer` flow).
- Keep commits atomic and reviewable; avoid bundling unrelated refactors.
- Keep commit messages short and action-oriented.
- Avoid embedding PR numbers in normal commits unless a repo requires it.

## Changelog Reminder

OpenClaw requires a changelog update for most changes. If a repo has explicit changelog rules, follow them.
